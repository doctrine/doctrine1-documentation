++ Introduction

Most users at one time or another have dealt with hierarchical data in a SQL database and no doubt learned that the management of hierarchical data is not what a relational database is intended for. The tables of a relational database are not hierarchical (like XML), but are simply a flat list. Hierarchical data has a parent-child relationship that is not naturally represented in a relational database table.

For our purposes, hierarchical data is a collection of data where each item has a single parent and zero or more children (with the exception of the root item, which has no parent). Hierarchical data can be found in a variety of database applications, including forum and mailing list threads, business organization charts, content management categories, and product categories.

In a hierarchical data model, data is organized into a tree-like structure. The tree structure allows repeating information using parent/child relationships. For an explanation of the tree data structure, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure here].

There are three major approaches to managing tree structures in relational databases, these are:

* the adjacency list model
* the nested set model (otherwise known as the modified pre-order tree traversal algorithm) 
* materialized path model 

**These are explained in more detail at the following links:**

++ Nested Set

+++ Introduction

Nested Set is a solution for storing hierarchical data that provides very fast read access. However, updating nested set trees is more costly. Therefore this solution is best suited for hierarchies that are much more frequently read than written to. And because of the nature of the web, this is the case for most web applications.

For more detailed information on the Nested Set, read here:

* [http://www.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database/2 http://www.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database/2]
* [http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/hierarchical-data.html http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/hierarchical-data.html]

+++ Setting Up

To set up your model as Nested Set, you must add some code to the {{setUp()}} method of your model. Take this {{Category}} model below for example:

<code type="php">
// models/Category.php

class Category extends Doctrine_Record
{
    public function setTableDefinition()
    {
        $this->hasColumn('name', 'string', 255);
    }

    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->actAs('NestedSet');       
    }
}
</code>

Here is the same example in YAML format. You can read more about YAML in the [doc yaml-schema-files :name] chapter:

<code type="yaml">
# schema.yml

# ...
Category:
  actAs: [NestedSet]
  columns:
    name: string(255)
</code>

Detailed information on Doctrine's templating model can be found in chapter [doc behaviors :index :name]. These templates add some functionality to your model. In the example of the nested set, your model gets 3 additional fields: {{lft}}, {{rgt}} and {{level}}. You never need to care about the {{lft}} and {{rgt}} fields. These are used internally to manage the tree structure. The {{level}} field however, is of interest for you because it's an integer value that represents the depth of a node within it's tree. A level of 0 means it's a root node. 1 means it's a direct child of a root node and so on. By reading the {{level}} field from your nodes you can easily display your tree with proper indention. 

> **CAUTION**
> You must never assign values to {{lft}}, {{rgt}}, {{level}}. These are managed transparently by the nested set implementation.

+++ Multiple Trees

The nested set implementation can be configured to allow your table to have multiple root nodes, and therefore multiple trees within the same table.

The example below shows how to setup and use multiple roots with the {{Category}} model:

<code type="php">
// models/Category.php

class Category extends Doctrine_Record
{
    // ...

    public function setUp()
    {
        $options = array(
            'hasManyRoots'     => true,
            'rootColumnName'   => 'root_id'
        );
        $this->actAs('NestedSet', $options);
    }
}
</code>

Here is the same example in YAML format. You can read more about YAML in the [doc yaml-schema-files :name] chapter:

<code type="yaml">
# schema.yml

# ...
Category:
  actAs:
    NestedSet:
      hasManyRoots: true
      rootColumnName: root_id
  columns:
    name: string(255)
</code>

The {{rootColumnName}} is the column used to differentiate between trees. When you create a new root node you have the option to set the {{root_id}} manually, otherwise Doctrine will assign a value for you.

In general use you do not need to deal with the {{root_id}} directly. For example, when you insert a new node into an existing tree or move a node between trees Doctrine transparently handles the associated {{root_id}} changes for you.

+++ Working with Trees

After you successfully set up your model as a nested set you can start working with it. Working with Doctrine's nested set implementation is all about two classes: {{Doctrine_Tree_NestedSet}} and {{Doctrine_Node_NestedSet}}. These are nested set implementations of the interfaces {{Doctrine_Tree_Interface}} and {{Doctrine_Node_Interface}}. Tree objects are bound to your table objects and node objects are bound to your record objects. This looks as follows:

The full tree interface is available by using the following code:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$treeObject = Doctrine_Core::getTable('Category')->getTree();
</code>

In the next example {{$category}} is an instance of {{Category}}:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$nodeObject = $category->getNode();
</code>

With the above code the full node interface is available on {{$nodeObject}}.

In the following sub-chapters you'll see code snippets that demonstrate the most frequently used operations with the node and tree classes.

++++ Creating a Root Node

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$category = new Category();
$category->name = 'Root Category 1';
$category->save();

$treeObject = Doctrine_Core::getTable('Category')->getTree();
$treeObject->createRoot($category);
</code>

++++ Inserting a Node

In the next example we're going to add a new {{Category}} instance as a child of the root {{Category}} we created above:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$child1 = new Category();
$child1->name = 'Child Category 1';

$child2 = new Category();
$child2->name = 'Child Category 1';

$child1->getNode()->insertAsLastChildOf($category);
$child2->getNode()->insertAsLastChildOf($category);
</code>

++++ Deleting a Node

Deleting a node from a tree is as simple as calling the {{delete()}} method on the node object:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$category = Doctrine_Core::getTable('Category')->findOneByName('Child Category 1');
$category->getNode()->delete();
</code>

> **CAUTION**
> The above code calls {{$category->delete()}} internally. It's important to delete on the node and not on the record. Otherwise you may corrupt the tree.

Deleting a node will also delete all descendants of that node. So make sure you move them elsewhere before you delete the node if you don't want to delete them.

++++ Moving a Node

Moving a node is simple. Doctrine offers several methods for moving nodes around between trees:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$category = new Category();
$category->name = 'Root Category 2';
$category->save();

$categoryTable = Doctrine_Core::getTable('Category');

$treeObject = $categoryTable->getTree();
$treeObject->createRoot($category);

$childCategory = $categoryTable->findOneByName('Child Category 1');
$childCategory->getNode()->moveAsLastChildOf($category);
...
</code>

Below is a list of the methods available for moving nodes around:

* moveAsLastChildOf($other)
* moveAsFirstChildOf($other)
* moveAsPrevSiblingOf($other)
* moveAsNextSiblingOf($other).

The method names should be self-explanatory to you.

++++ Examining a Node

You can examine the nodes and what type of node they are by using some of the following functions:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$isLeaf = $category->getNode()->isLeaf();
$isRoot = $category->getNode()->isRoot();
</code>

> **NOTE**
> The above used functions return true/false depending on whether or not they are a leaf or root node.

++++ Examining and Retrieving Siblings

You can easily check if a node has any next or previous siblings by using the following methods:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$hasNextSib = $category->getNode()->hasNextSibling();
$hasPrevSib = $category->getNode()->hasPrevSibling();
</code>

You can also retrieve the next or previous siblings if they exist with the following methods:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$nextSib = $category->getNode()->getNextSibling();
$prevSib = $category->getNode()->getPrevSibling();
</code>

> **NOTE**
> The above methods return false if no next or previous sibling exists.

If you want to retrieve an array of all the siblings you can simply use the {{getSiblings()}} method:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$siblings = $category->getNode()->getSiblings();
</code>

++++ Examining and Retrieving Descendants

You can check if a node has a parent or children by using the following methods:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$hasChildren = $category->getNode()->hasChildren();
$hasParent = $category->getNode()->hasParent();
</code>

You can retrieve a nodes first and last child by using the following methods:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$firstChild = $category->getNode()->getFirstChild();
$lastChild = $category->getNode()->getLastChild();
</code>

Or if you want to retrieve the parent of a node:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$parent = $category->getNode()->getParent();
</code>

You can get the children of a node by using the following method:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$children = $category->getNode()->getChildren();
</code>

> **CAUTION**
> The {{getChildren()}} method returns only the direct descendants. If you want all descendants, use the {{getDescendants()}} method. 

You can get the descendants or ancestors of a node by using the following methods:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$descendants = $category->getNode()->getDescendants();
$ancestors = $category->getNode()->getAncestors();
</code>

Sometimes you may just want to get the number of children or descendants. You can use the following methods to accomplish this:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$numChildren = $category->getNode()->getNumberChildren();
$numDescendants = $category->getNode()->getNumberDescendants();
</code>

The {{getDescendants()}} and {{getAncestors()}} both accept a parameter that you can use to specify the {{depth}} of the resulting branch. For example {{getDescendants(1)}} retrieves only the direct descendants (the descendants that are 1 level below, that's the same as {{getChildren()}}). In the same fashion {{getAncestors(1)}} would only retrieve the direct ancestor (the parent), etc.{{ getAncestors()}} can be very useful to efficiently determine the path of this node up to the root node or up to some specific ancestor (i.e. to construct a breadcrumb navigation).

++++ Rendering a Simple Tree

> **NOTE**
> The next example assumes you have {{hasManyRoots}} set to false so in order for the below example to work properly you will have to set that option to false. We set the value to true in a earlier section.

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$treeObject = Doctrine_Core::getTable('Category')->getTree();
$tree = $treeObject->fetchTree();

foreach ($tree as $node) {
    echo str_repeat('&nbsp;&nbsp;', $node['level']) . $node['name'] . "\n";
}
</code>

+++ Advanced Usage

The previous sections have explained the basic usage of Doctrine's nested set implementation. This section will go one step further.

++++ Fetching a Tree with Relations

If you're a demanding software developer this question may already have come into your mind: "How do I fetch a tree/branch with related data?". Simple example: You want to display a tree of categories, but you also want to display some related data of each category, let's say some details of the hottest product in that category. Fetching the tree as seen in the previous sections and simply accessing the relations while iterating over the tree is possible but produces a lot of unnecessary database queries. Luckily, {{Doctrine_Query}} and some flexibility in the nested set implementation have come to your rescue. The nested set implementation uses {{Doctrine_Query}} objects for all it's database work. By giving you access to the base query object of the nested set implementation you can unleash the full power of {{Doctrine_Query}} while using your nested set.

First lets create the query we want to use to retrieve our tree data with:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$q = Doctrine_Query::create()
    ->select('c.name, p.name, m.name')
    ->from('Category c')
    ->leftJoin('c.HottestProduct p')
    ->leftJoin('p.Manufacturer m');
</code>

Now we need to set the above query as the base query for the tree:

<code type="php">
$treeObject = Doctrine_Core::getTable('Category')->getTree();
$treeObject->setBaseQuery($q);
$tree = $treeObject->fetchTree();
</code>

There it is, the tree with all the related data you need, all in one query.

> **NOTE**
> If you don't set your own base query then one will be automatically created for you internally.

When you are done it is a good idea to reset the base query back to normal:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$treeObject->resetBaseQuery();
</code>

You can take it even further. As mentioned in the chapter [doc improving-performance :name] you should only fetch objects when you need them. So, if we need the tree only for display purposes (read-only) we can use the array hydration to speed things up a bit:

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$q = Doctrine_Query::create()
    ->select('c.name, p.name, m.name')
    ->from('Category c')
    ->leftJoin('c.HottestProduct p')
    ->leftJoin('p.Manufacturer m')
    ->setHydrationMode(Doctrine_Core::HYDRATE_ARRAY);

$treeObject = Doctrine_Core::getTable('Category')->getTree();
$treeObject->setBaseQuery($q);
$tree = $treeObject->fetchTree();
$treeObject->resetBaseQuery();
</code>

Now you got a nicely structured array in {{$tree}} and if you use array access on your records anyway, such a change will not even effect any other part of your code. This method of modifying the query can be used for all node and tree methods ({{getAncestors()}}, {{getDescendants()}}, {{getChildren()}}, {{getParent()}}, ...). Simply create your query, set it as the base query on the tree object and then invoke the appropriate method.

+++ Rendering with Indention

Below you will find an example where all trees are rendered with proper indention. You can retrieve the roots using the {{fetchRoots()}} method and retrieve each individual tree by using the {{fetchTree()}} method.

<code type="php">
// test.php

// ...
$treeObject = Doctrine_Core::getTable('Category')->getTree();
$rootColumnName = $treeObject->getAttribute('rootColumnName');

foreach ($treeObject->fetchRoots() as $root) {
  $options = array(
      'root_id' => $root->$rootColumnName
  );
  foreach($treeObject->fetchTree($options) as $node) {
    echo str_repeat(' ', $node['level']) . $node['name'] . "\n";
  }
}
</code>

After doing all the examples above the code above should render as follows:

<code>
$ php test.php 
Root Category 1
Root Category 2
 Child Category 1
</code>

++ Conclusion

Now that we have learned all about the {{NestedSet}} behavior and how to manage our hierarchical data using Doctrine we are ready to learn about [doc data-fixtures :name]. Data fixtures are a great tool for loading small sets of test data in to your applications to be used for unit and functional tests or to populate your application with its initial data.
